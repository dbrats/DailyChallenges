I know that we are young
And I know that you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Alejandro

She's got both hands
In her pocket
And she won't look at you (won't look at you)
She hides true love
En su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger
Around you

You know that I love you boy
Hot like Mexico
Rejoice
At this point I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Alejandro
I'm not your babe

Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette, hush

Please, just let me go
Alejandro
Just let me go

She's not broken
She's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like her dad
Just like a dad
And all those flames that
Burned before him
Now he's gotta firefight
Gotta cool the bad

You know that I love you boy
Hot like Mexico
Rejoice
At this point I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Alejandro
I'm not your babe

I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please
Fold 'em, let 'em, hit me, raise it, baby, stay with me (I love it)
Love game intuition play the cards with Spades to start
And after he's been hooked I'll play the one that's on his heart

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-e-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-e-oh-oh-oh,
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got

Can't read my,
Can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(she's got me like nobody)
Can't read my
Can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(she's got me like nobody)

P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
(Mum mum mum mah)
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
(Mum mum mum mah)

I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be
A little gambling is fun when you're with me (I love it)
Russian Roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby when it's love if it's not rough it isn't fun, fun

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-e-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-e-oh-oh-oh,
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got


P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
(Mum mum mum mah)
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
(Mum mum mum mah)
(Mum mum mum mah)
(Mum mum mum mah)

I won't tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you
Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin
I'm not lying, I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue-gunning
Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand cause I'm marvelous

P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
(Mum mum mum mah)
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
(Mum mum mum mah)
